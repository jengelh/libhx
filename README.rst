libHX collects many useful day-to-day functions, intended to reduce the amount
of otherwise repeatedly open-coded instructions.

It has maps, deques, linked lists, string formatting and autoresizing, option
and config file parsing, type checking casts (for C), directory traversal, etc.

There is more documentation in the aptly-named directory ``doc``.
The entrypoint is `doc/libHX_Documentation.rst <doc/libHX_Documentation.rst>`_.
