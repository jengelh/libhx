History
=======

The origins of libHX trace back, even crossing a language boundary, to when the
author started on using Perl in 1999. Some tasks were just too damn useful to
be open-coded every time. Two such examples are what is these days known as
``HX_basename`` and ``HX_mkdir``. The name does not relate to anyone's
initials; it is a result of a truncation of the author's nick used years ago.

Around the beginning of 2003, the author also started on the C programming
language and soon the small library was converted from Perl to C. The libHX
library as of today is the result of working with C ever since, and naturally
grew from there to support whatever the author was in need of.

The “correct” name for libHX is with an uppercase “H” and uppercase “X”, and
the same is used for filenames, such as “libHX.so”[#lowercase]

.. [#lowercase] Software projects may choose to entirely lowercase the project
                name for use in filenames, such as the Linux kernel which is
                released as ``linux-${version}.tar.bz2``, or the project may
                choose to keep the name for filenames, like Mesa and SDL do.
                libHX is of the latter.
