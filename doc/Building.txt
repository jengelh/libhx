DESCRIPTION

    It is an all-purpose library, providing commonly used functions not
    available in standard libc's as well as OS-abstracted functions for
    various things. This HTML file's layout is not the best, but seems to
    suffice for now.


BUILDING WITH GCC

    Have GNU make installed and just run `./Mk`. If you want to pass
    additional CFLAGS or LDFLAGS, you can do so by:

        ./Mk EXT_CFLAGS="-O3"

    (For LDFLAGS, the variable is EXT_LDFLAGS.) To enable debugging
    support, you do not need to pass EXT_CFLAGS="-O0 -ggdb3" but simply
    DEBUG=1. If you also want to see the commands that make executes, pass
    V=1 as an argument.


INSTALLING THE RPM PACKAGE

    I provide precompiled RPM packages for i586-gnu-linux on my webpage.
    They can be installed with the following commands:

        rpm -Uhv libHX-%version.%arch.rpm

    (Replace %version and %arch accordingly.) It may be necessary to run
    `ldconfig`, but should not if you use GNU binutils for your
    application development.


COMPILATION WITH TCPP (DOS)

    The command is `tmake -fMakefile.tcc`. The resulting file libHX??.lib
    is the library file you need to link against when using its functions.

    It is not guaranteed that libHX will compile at the moment, I have
    pretty much ceased using TCPP.
