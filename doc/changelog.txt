- defs: resolve warnings with signed_cast() for char* -> const char* conversions
- dir: HX_rrmdir: do not stop on error
- opt: fix interpretation of strings during conversion to bool
  (all strings that were not empty and not 0 were interpreted as "true",
  and this included the strings "no", "off" and "false", which should
  actually have mapped to, well, "false".)

New feature: Type-checking casts.
- defs: enable type-checking signed_cast()

- defs: rewrite const_cast() to do type checking
  (actually, const_cast1(), cosnt_cast2() and const_cast3() were introduced.
  const_cast() is kept to not break program compilation.)

Removals:
- mc: remove HXmc_dup
  [you can use HXmc_meminit(old, HXmc_length(old))]
- string: HX_strmid behavior changed for length=0
  [no more "remaining string", now returns a zero-length string]
