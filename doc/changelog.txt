libHX 1.27 (October 23 2008)
============================
No functional changes for Linux platforms.

- build: fixed compile errors with i586-mingw32msvc cross compile
- regenerated the Makefile.in files in the tarball with an updated
  version of automake-tranquility so that they are now
  POSIX-compliant and work with BSD make


libHX 1.26 (October 12 2008)
============================
- add HX_hexdump() for debugging within programs
- fix double free in the error path of HX_getopt() when a long option preceded
  a short option of which the latter had problems (i.e. missing argument)
- add actual typechecking to signed_cast()
- add typechecking to static_cast(),
  (but this is normally disabled to avoid compile interruption)


libHX 1.25 (September 07 2008)
==============================
- install missing misc.h
- HXmc: pointer was not automatically updated after hmc_trunc()
- HXmc: rename functions and put them into the HX* namespace (API change)

  HXmc_strcpy(hxmc, "")
- HXmc: make code resistant to memory allocation failure

==============================
- code cleanup: misc.h has been split off libHX.h

================================
